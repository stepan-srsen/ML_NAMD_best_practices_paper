# Data-driven insights and best practices on machine learning nonadiabatic dynamics simulations

## Abstract

Exploring molecular excited states holds immense significance across organic chemistry, chemical biology, and materials science and understanding the photophysical properties of molecular chromophores is crucial for designing nature-inspired functional molecules, with applications ranging from photosynthesis to pharmaceuticals. Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations are powerful to investigate the photochemistry of molecules and materials, but demand extensive computing resources, especially for complex molecules and environments. To address these challenges, the integration of machine learning has emerged. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze vast datasets and accelerate discoveries by identifying relationships between geometrical features and ground and excited-state properties. However, challenges persist, including acquiring accurate excited-state data and managing the complexity of the data. This article provides an overview of recent and best practices in machine learning for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, focusing on pre-processing, surface fitting, and post-processing of data.
