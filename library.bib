The new formulation is based on the introduction of average values in the unperturbed state of excitation operators which bear resemblance with analogous ones occurring in the extended Koopmans’ theorem and in the equations-of-motion technique. Such auxiliary quantities, which allow the second-order perturbation contribution to the energy to be evaluated very efficiently, can be calculated at the outset provided the unperturbed four-particle spinless density matrix in the active orbital space is available. A noticeable inequality concerning second-order energy contributions of the same type between the strongly and partially contracted versions is proven to hold. An example concerning the successful calculation of the potential energy curve for the Cr2 molecule is discussed.},

   abstract = {Light-induced chemical processes are ubiquitous in nature and have widespread technological applications. For example, photoisomerization can allow a drug with a photo-switchable scaffold such as azobenzene to be activated with light. In principle, photoswitches with desired photophysical properties like high isomerization quantum yields can be identified through virtual screening with reactive simulations. In practice, these simulations are rarely used for screening, since they require hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum chemical methods to account for non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we introduce a diabatic artificial neural network (DANN), based on diabatic states, to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The network is six orders of magnitude faster than the quantum chemistry method used for training. DANN is transferable to azobenzene molecules outside the training set, predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are correlated with experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3100 hypothetical molecules, and identify novel species with high predicted quantum yields. The model predictions are confirmed using high-accuracy non-adiabatic dynamics. Our results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual screening of photoactive compounds.},

   pages = {064107},
   abstract = {A very simple equation, FijApp=[(∂2(Via−Vja)/∂Q2)/(Via−Vja)]1/2/2, giving a reliable magnitude of non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACTs, Fij’s) based on adiabatic potential energies only (Via and Vja) was discovered, and its reliability was tested for several prototypes of same-symmetry interstate crossings in LiF, C2, NH3Cl, and C6H5SH molecules. Our theoretical derivation starts from the analysis of the relationship between the Lorentzian dependence of NACTs along a diabatization coordinate and the well-established linear vibronic coupling scheme. This analysis results in a very simple equation, α=2κ/Δc, enabling the evaluation of the Lorentz function α parameter in terms of the coupling constant κ and the energy gap Δc (Δc=|Via−Vja|Qc) between adiabatic states at the crossing point QC. Subsequently, it was shown that QC corresponds to the point where FijApp exhibit maximum values if we set the coupling parameter as κ=[(Via−Vja)⋅(∂2(Via−Vja)/∂Q2)]Qc1/2/2. Finally, we conjectured that this relation could give reasonable values of NACTs not only at the crossing point but also at other geometries near QC. In this final approximation, the pre-defined crossing point QC is not required. The results of our test demonstrate that the approximation works much better than initially expected. The present new method does not depend on the selection of an ab initio method for adiabatic electronic states but is currently limited to local non-adiabatic regions where only two electronic states are dominantly involved within a nuclear degree of freedom.},

Different spectroscopic techniques (spanning different ranges of the electromagnetic field) and their combination can lead to a more comprehensive picture of investigated systems. However, the growing sophistication of these experimental techniques makes it increasingly complex to interpret spectroscopic results without the help of computational chemistry. Computational molecular spectroscopy, born as a branch of quantum chemistry to provide predictions of spectroscopic properties and features, emerged as an independent and highly specialized field but has progressively evolved to become a general tool also employed by experimentally oriented researchers. In this Primer, we focus on the computational characterization of medium-sized molecular systems by means of different spectroscopic techniques. We first provide essential information about the characteristics, accuracy and limitations of the available computational approaches, and select examples to illustrate common trends and outcomes of general validity that can be used for modelling spectroscopic phenomena. We emphasize the need for estimating error bars and limitations, coupling accuracy with interpretability, touch upon data deposition and reproducibility issues, and discuss the results in terms of widely recognized chemical concepts.},

By using the first-order effective Hamiltonian coupling elements, the weighting scheme implicitly takes into account the symmetry of the states, thereby averaging Fock operators only if the zeroth-order wave functions interact with each other. The use of Hamiltonian couplings also provides a physically sounder approach to quantitate the relative weights; however, it introduces new difficulties when these rapidly die off to zero. The improved XDW-CASPT2 method is critically tested on several systems of photochemical relevance, and it is shown that it succeeds in its original intent of maintaining MS-CASPT2 accuracy for the evaluation of transition energies and at the same time providing smooth potential energy surfaces around near-degenerate points akin to XMS-CASPT2.},

   abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets. The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications, MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many (typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24 (!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction. These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator and many model potential functions already have this required structure. For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation (CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is “learned” by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems. A recipe for the construction of these potentials is given and remaining limitations of the method are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Quenching to the ground electronic state is found to be ultrafast and proceeds from an ionic state via a conical intersection. Accessing the conical intersection requires pyramidalization of one of the methylene groups and this can happen only after energy is funneled from the twisting mode into the pyramidalization mode.},

By using a well-behaved high-spin state as a reference, one can access problematic low-spin states by deploying the same formal tools as in the excited-state treatments (i.e., linear response, propagator, or equation-of-motion theories). The Perspective reviews applications of this strategy within wave function and density functional theory frameworks as well as the extensions for molecular properties and spectroscopy. The utility of spin-flip methods is illustrated by examples. Limitations and proposed future directions are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing classical force fields constitute the cornerstone of contemporary atomistic modeling in chemistry, biology, and materials science. However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.},

FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom. The model presented herein is fast and lightweight enough for use in general chemistry problems as well as molecular dynamics simulations.},

In this paper, we present developments to the DD-vMCG algorithm that improve both its accuracy and efficiency. First, a new, efficient parallel algorithm to control the DD-vMCG database of quantum chemistry points is presented along with improvements to the Shepard interpolation scheme. Second, the use of symmetry in describing the potential surfaces is introduced along with a new phase convention in the propagation diabatization. Benchmark calculations on the allene radical cation including all degrees of freedom then show that the new scheme is able to produce a consistent non-adiabatic coupling vector field. This new DD-vMCG version thus opens the route for effectively and accurately treating complex chemical systems using quantum dynamics simulations.},

In other situations the dissimilarity measure might be based on a data matrix. The general aim of multidimensional scaling is to find a configuration of points in a space, usually Euclidean, where each point represents one of the objects or individuals, and the distances between pairs of points in the configuration match as well as possible the original dissimilarities between the pairs of objects or individuals. Such configurations can be found using metric and non-metric scaling, which are covered in Sects. 2 and 3. A number of other techniques are covered by the umbrella title of multidimensional scaling (MDS), and here the techniques of Procrustes analysis, unidimensional scaling, individual differences scaling, correspondence analysis and reciprocal averaging are briefly introduced and illustrated with pertinent data sets.},

   abstract = {Trajectory-based fewest-switches surface-hopping (FSSH) dynamics simulations have become a popular and reliable theoretical tool to simulate nonadiabatic photophysical and photochemical processes. Most available FSSH methods model internal conversion. We present a generalized trajectory surface-hopping (GTSH) method for simulating both internal conversion and intersystem crossing processes on an equal footing. We consider hops between adiabatic eigenstates of the non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian (pure spin states), which is appropriate for sufficiently small spin-orbit coupling. This choice allows us to make maximum use of existing electronic structure programs and to minimize the changes to available implementations of the traditional FSSH method. The GTSH method is formulated within the quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanics framework, but can of course also be applied at the pure QM level. The algorithm implemented in the GTSH code is specified step by step. As an initial GTSH application, we report simulations of the nonadiabatic processes in the lowest four electronic states (S0, S1, T1, and T2) of acrolein both in vacuo and in acetonitrile solution, in which the acrolein molecule is treated at the ab initio complete-active-space self-consistent-field level. These dynamics simulations provide detailed mechanistic insight by identifying and characterizing two nonadiabatic routes to the lowest triplet state, namely, direct S1 → T1 hopping as major pathway and sequential S1 → T2 → T1 hopping as minor pathway, with the T2 state acting as a relay state. They illustrate the potential of the GTSH approach to explore photoinduced processes in complex systems, in which intersystem crossing plays an important role.},

Unfortunately, such wavefunctions are also notoriously difficult to evaluate due to their extreme computational demands. The dimension of a full CI procedure, which represents the exact solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation for a fixed one-particle basis set, grows factorially with the number of electrons and basis functions. For very large configuration spaces, the number of CI coupling coefficients becomes prohibitively large to store on disk; these coefficients must be evaluated as needed in a so-called direct CI procedure. Work done by several groups since 1980 has focused on using Slater determinants rather than spin (S^2) eigenfunctions because coupling coefficients are easier to compute with the former. We review the fundamentals of the configuration interaction method and discuss various determinant-based CI algorithms. Additionally, we consider some applications of highly correlated CI methods.},

Owing to their size-consistency, ADC methods are suited for the investigation of large molecules. In addition, their Hermitian structure and the availability of the intermediate state representation (ISR) allow for straightforward computation of excited-state properties. Recently, an efficient implementation of ADC(3) has been reported, and its high accuracy for typical valence excited states of organic chromophores has been demonstrated. In this review, the origin of ADC-based excited-state methods in propagator theory is described, and an intuitive route for the derivation of algebraic expressions via the ISR is outlined and comparison to other excited-state methods is made. Existing computer codes and implemented ADC variants are reviewed, but most importantly the accuracy and limits of different ADC schemes are critically examined.

   abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In the present work, we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects – typically neglected by conventional quantum chemistry approaches – we base our machine learning strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning techniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude, but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this end, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference points. This is made possible through the use of molecular forces during neural network potential training and the introduction of a fully automated sampling scheme. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide, which at the same time represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the dynamics of a peptide. In all of these case studies we find an excellent agreement between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the respective theoretical and experimental spectra.},

For five organic molecules ranging from 5 to 13 heavy atoms, the model accurately predicts molecular orbital energies and wave functions and provides access to derived properties for chemical bonding analysis. Particularly for larger molecules, the model outperforms the original atomic-orbital-based SchNOrb method in terms of accuracy and scaling. We conclude by discussing the future potential of this approach in quantum chemical workflows.},

In recent years, machine learning has extended the boundaries of quantum chemistry by providing highly accurate and efficient surrogate models of electronic structure theory, which previously have been out of reach for conventional approaches. Those models have long been restricted to closed molecular systems without accounting for environmental influences, such as external electric and magnetic fields or solvent effects. Here, we introduce the deep neural network FieldSchNet for modeling the interaction of molecules with arbitrary external fields. FieldSchNet offers access to a wealth of molecular response properties, enabling it to simulate a wide range of molecular spectra, such as infrared, Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance. Beyond that, it is able to describe implicit and explicit molecular environments, operating as a polarizable continuum model for solvation or in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics setup. We employ FieldSchNet to study the influence of solvent effects on molecular spectra and a Claisen rearrangement reaction. Based on these results, we use FieldSchNet to design an external environment capable of lowering the activation barrier of the rearrangement reaction significantly, demonstrating promising venues for inverse chemical design.},

Due to the proximity of the Rydberg π-3s state with the ππ* state, the states are mixed favoring ultrafast exchange of population via a conical intersection that closely resembles the equilibrium structure. After excitation, it is found that the π-3s state acts as a doorway state, trapping the population and delaying internal conversion to the ππ* state, from which deactivation to the closed-shell ground state takes place. Besides the conical intersection between the π-3s and ππ* states, five additional conical intersections between the ππ* state and the ground state are found, indicating that after the system is excited, it stretches the CC bond before it twists and pyramidalizes at any of the carbon atoms, in the spirit of a hula-twist mechanism.},

   abstract = {Most chemical transformations (reactions or conformational changes) that are of interest to researchers have many degrees of freedom, usually too many to visualize without reducing the dimensionality of the system to include only the most important atomic motions. In this article, we describe a method of using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for analyzing a series of molecular geometries (e.g., a reaction pathway or molecular dynamics trajectory) and determining the reduced dimensional space that captures the most structural variance in the fewest dimensions. The software written to carry out this method is called PathReducer, which permits (1) visualizing the geometries in a reduced dimensional space, (2) determining the axes that make up the reduced dimensional space, and (3) projecting the series of geometries into the low-dimensional space for visualization. We investigated two options to represent molecular structures within PathReducer: aligned Cartesian coordinates and matrices of interatomic distances. We found that interatomic distance matrices better captured non-linear motions in a smaller number of dimensions. To demonstrate the utility of PathReducer, we have carried out a number of applications where we have projected molecular dynamics trajectories into a reduced dimensional space defined by an intrinsic reaction coordinate. The visualizations provided by this analysis show that dynamic paths can differ greatly from the minimum energy pathway on a potential energy surface. Viewing intrinsic reaction coordinates and trajectories in this way provides a quick way to gather qualitative information about the pathways trajectories take relative to a minimum energy path. Given that the outputs from PCA are linear combinations of the input molecular structure coordinates (i.e., Cartesian coordinates or interatomic distances), they can be easily transferred to other types of calculations that require the definition of a reduced dimensional space (e.g., biased molecular dynamics simulations).},

This is demonstrated by training machine learning models to predict directly a specific outcome quantity of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations – the timescale of the decomposition of 1,2-dioxetane. The machine learning models accurately reproduce the dissociation time of the compound. Keeping the aim of gaining physical insight, it is demonstrated that, in order to make accurate predictions, the models evidence empirical rules that are, today, part of the common chemical knowledge.

Then, its practical use for calculating vertical excitations and potential energy surfaces, including conical intersections, is accessed. Finally, the use of LR-TDDFT for excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics is discussed. Diverse variants of the method and alternative ways to predict excited states based on DFT are presented as well.

By providing funnels for efficient non-adiabatic population transfer, conical intersections govern the branching ratio of products of such reactions, similar to what the transition states do for ground-state reactivity. In this regard, intersections between the ground and the lowest excited states play a special role, and the correct description of the potential energy surfaces in their vicinity is crucial for understanding the mechanism and dynamics of excited-state reactions. The methods of density functional theory, such as time-dependent density functional theory, are widely used to describe the excited states of large molecules. However, are these methods suitable for describing the conical intersections or do they lead to artifacts and, consequently, to erroneous description of reaction dynamics? Here we address the first part of this question and analyze the ability of several density functional approaches, including the linear-response time-dependent approach as well as the spin-flip and ensemble formalisms, to provide the correct description of conical intersections and the potential energy surfaces in their vicinity. It is demonstrated that the commonly used linear-response time-dependent theory does not yield a proper description of these features and that one should instead use alternative computational approaches.},

We discuss some details of the implementation of AIMS in the Molpro program package. A few aspects of the implementation are highlighted, including a new multiple timescale integrator and a scheme for solving the coupled-perturbed multiconfiguration self-consistent field (CP-MCSCF) equations in the context of ab initio molecular dynamics. The implementation is very efficient and we demonstrate calculations on the photoisomerization of ethylene using more than 5000 trajectory basis functions. We have included the capability for hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations within AIMS, and we investigate the role of an argon solvent in the photoisomerization of ethylene. Somewhat surprisingly, the surrounding argon has little effect on the timescale of non-adiabatic quenching in ethylene.},

   abstract = {Photochemical reactions are widely used by academic and industrial researchers to construct complex molecular architectures via mechanisms that often require harsh reaction conditions. Photodynamics simulations provide time-resolved snapshots of molecular excited-state structures required to understand and predict reactivities and chemoselectivities. Molecular excited-states are often nearly degenerate and require computationally intensive multiconfigurational quantum mechanical methods, especially at conical intersections. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics require thousands of these computations per trajectory, which limits simulations to ∼1 picosecond for most organic photochemical reactions. Westermayr et al. recently introduced a neural-network-based method to accelerate the predictions of electronic properties and pushed the simulation limit to 1 ns for the model system, methylenimmonium cation (CH2NH2+). We have adapted this methodology to develop the Python-based, Python Rapid Artificial Intelligence Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (PyRAI2MD) software for the cis–trans isomerization of trans-hexafluoro-2-butene and the 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing of a norbornyl hexacyclodiene. We performed a 10 ns simulation for trans-hexafluoro-2-butene in just 2 days. The same simulation would take approximately 58 years with traditional multiconfigurational photodynamics simulations. We generated training data by combining Wigner sampling, geometrical interpolations, and short-time quantum chemical trajectories to adaptively sample sparse data regions along reaction coordinates. The final data set of the cis–trans isomerization and the 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing model has 6207 and 6267 data points, respectively. The training errors in energy using feedforward neural networks achieved chemical accuracy (0.023–0.032 eV). The neural network photodynamics simulations of trans-hexafluoro-2-butene agree with the quantum chemical calculations showing the formation of the cis-product and reactive carbene intermediate. The neural network trajectories of the norbornyl cyclohexadiene corroborate the low-yielding syn-product, which was absent in the quantum chemical trajectories, and revealed subsequent thermal reactions in 1 ns.},

   abstract = {We propose an “automatic” approach to analyze the results of the on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping simulation on the multi-channel nonadiabatic photoisomerization dynamics by considering the trajectory similarity and the configuration similarity. We choose a representative system phytochromobilin (PΦB) chromophore model to illustrate the analysis protocol. After a large number of trajectories are obtained, it is possible to define the similarity of different trajectories by the Fréchet distance and to employ the trajectory clustering analysis to divide all trajectories into several clusters. Each cluster in principle represents a photoinduced isomerization reaction channel. This idea provides an effective approach to understand the branching ratio of the multi-channel photoisomerization dynamics. For each cluster, the dimensionality reduction is employed to understand the configuration similarity in the trajectory propagation, which provides the understanding of the major geometry evolution features in each reaction channel. The results show that this analysis protocol not only assigns all trajectories into different photoisomerization reaction channels but also extracts the major molecular motion without the requirement of the pre-known knowledge of the active photoisomerization site. As a side product of this analysis tool, it is also easy to find the so-called “typical” or “representative” trajectory for each reaction channel.},

   abstract = {Intersystem crossing is a radiationless process that can take place in a molecule irradiated by UV-Vis light, thereby playing an important role in many environmental, biological and technological processes. This paper reviews different methods to describe intersystem crossing dynamics, paying attention to semiclassical trajectory theories, which are especially interesting because they can be applied to large systems with many degrees of freedom. In particular, a general trajectory surface hopping methodology recently developed by the authors, which is able to include nonadiabatic and spin-orbit couplings in excited-state dynamics simulations, is explained in detail. This method, termed SHARC, can in principle include any arbitrary coupling, what makes it generally applicable to photophysical and photochemical problems, also those including explicit laser fields. A step-by-step derivation of the main equations of motion employed in surface hopping based on the fewest-switches method of Tully, adapted for the inclusion of spin-orbit interactions, is provided. Special emphasis is put on describing the different possible choices of the electronic bases in which spin-orbit can be included in surface hopping, highlighting the advantages and inconsistencies of the different approaches. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Abstract Many light-induced molecular processes involve a change in spin state and are formally forbidden in non-relativistic quantum theory. To make them happen, spin?orbit coupling (SOC) has to be invoked. Intersystem crossing (ISC), the nonradiative transition between two electronic states of different multiplicity, plays a key role in photochemistry and photophysics with a broad range of applications including molecular photonics, biological photosensors, photodynamic therapy, and materials science. Quantum chemistry has become a valuable tool for gaining detailed insight into the mechanisms of ISC. After a short introduction highlighting the importance of ISC and a brief description of the relativistic origins of SOC, this article focusses on approximate SOC operators for practical use in molecular applications and reviews state-of-the-art theoretical methods for evaluating ISC rates. Finally, a few sample applications are discussed that underline the necessity of studying the mechanisms of ISC processes beyond qualitative rules such as the El-Sayed rules and the energy gap law. ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract In recent years, dimensionality-reduction techniques have been developed and are widely used for hypothesis generation in Exploratory Data Analysis. However, these techniques are confronted with overcoming the trade-off between computation time and the quality of the provided dimensionality reduction. In this work, we address this limitation, by introducing Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hierarchical-SNE). Using a hierarchical representation of the data, we incorporate the well-known mantra of Overview-First, Details-On-Demand in non-linear dimensionality reduction. First, the analysis shows an embedding, that reveals only the dominant structures in the data (Overview). Then, by selecting structures that are visible in the overview, the user can filter the data and drill down in the hierarchy. While the user descends into the hierarchy, detailed visualizations of the high-dimensional structures will lead to new insights. In this paper, we explain how Hierarchical-SNE scales to the analysis of big datasets. In addition, we show its application potential in the visualization of Deep-Learning architectures and the analysis of hyperspectral images.},

   abstract = {Quantum-chemistry simulations based on potential energy surfaces of molecules provide invaluable insight into the physicochemical processes at the atomistic level and yield such important observables as reaction rates and spectra. Machine learning potentials promise to significantly reduce the computational cost and hence enable otherwise unfeasible simulations. However, the surging number of such potentials begs the question of which one to choose or whether we still need to develop yet another one. Here, we address this question by evaluating the performance of popular machine learning potentials in terms of accuracy and computational cost. In addition, we deliver structured information for non-specialists in machine learning to guide them through the maze of acronyms, recognize each potential's main features, and judge what they could expect from each one.},

   pages = {57-69},
   abstract = {We report an implementation of the linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model within the surface hopping dynamics approach and present utilities for parameterizing this model in a blackbox fashion. This results in an extremely efficient method to obtain qualitative and even semi-quantitative information about the photodynamical behavior of a molecule, and provides a new route toward benchmarking the results of surface hopping computations. The merits and applicability of the method are demonstrated in a number of applications. First, the method is applied to the SO2 molecule showing that it is possible to compute its absorption spectrum beyond the Condon approximation, and that all the main features and timescales of previous on-the-fly dynamics simulations of intersystem crossing are reproduced while reducing the computational effort by three orders of magnitude. The dynamics results are benchmarked against exact wavepacket propagations on the same LVC potentials and against a variation of the electronic structure level. Four additional test cases are presented to exemplify the broader applicability of the model. The photodynamics of the isomeric adenine and 2-aminopurine molecules are studied and it is shown that the LVC model correctly predicts ultrafast decay in the former and an extended excited-state lifetime in the latter. Futhermore, the method correctly predicts ultrafast intersystem crossing in the modified nucleobase 2-thiocytosine and its absence in 5-azacytosine while it fails to describe the ultrafast internal conversion to the ground state in the latter.},

   abstract = {In this work, the advantages of a locally diabatic propagation of the electronic wave function in surface hopping dynamics proceeding on adiabatic surfaces are presented providing very stable results even in challenging cases of highly peaked nonadiabatic interactions. The method was applied to the simulation of transport phenomena in the stacked ethylene dimer radical cation and the hydrogen bonded 2-pyridone dimer. Systematic tests showed the reliability of the method, in situations where standard methods relying on an adiabatic propagation of the wave function and explicit calculation of the nonadiabatic coupling terms exhibited significant numerical instabilities. Investigations of the ethylene dimer radical cation with an intermolecular distance of 7.0 Å provided a quantitative description of diabatic charge trapping. For the 2-pyidone dimer, a complex dynamics was obtained: a very fast (&lt;10 fs) initial S2/S1 internal conversion; subsequent excitation energy transfers with a characteristic time of 207 fs; and the occurrence of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) in 26% of the trajectories. The computed characteristic excitation energy transfer time of 207 fs is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental value of 318 fs derived from the vibronic exciton splittings in a monodeuterated 2-pyridone dimer complex. The importance of nonadiabatic coupling for the PCET related to the electron transfer was demonstrated by the dynamics simulations.},

In order to extend this approach to excited-state dynamics, one must not only learn the potentials but also nonadiabatic coupling vectors (NACs). There is a particular difficulty in learning NACs in systems that exhibit conical intersections, as due to the geometric-phase effect, the NACs may be double-valued and are, thus, not suitable as training data for standard machine-learning techniques. In this work, we introduce a set of auxiliary single-valued functions from which the NACs can be reconstructed, thus enabling a reliable machine-learning approach.},

   abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented. The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space, and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule, using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098), 1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1, for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an active and an inactive part.},

   abstract = {Machine-learning force fields (MLFF) should be accurate, computationally and data efficient, and applicable to molecules, materials, and interfaces thereof. Currently, MLFFs often introduce tradeoffs that restrict their practical applicability to small subsets of chemical space or require exhaustive datasets for training. Here, we introduce the Bravais-Inspired Gradient-Domain Machine Learning (BIGDML) approach and demonstrate its ability to construct reliable force fields using a training set with just 10–200 geometries for materials including pristine and defect-containing 2D and 3D semiconductors and metals, as well as chemisorbed and physisorbed atomic and molecular adsorbates on surfaces. The BIGDML model employs the full relevant symmetry group for a given material, does not assume artificial atom types or localization of atomic interactions and exhibits high data efficiency and state-of-the-art energy accuracies (errors substantially below 1 meV per atom) for an extended set of materials. Extensive path-integral molecular dynamics carried out with BIGDML models demonstrate the counterintuitive localization of benzene–graphene dynamics induced by nuclear quantum effects and their strong contributions to the hydrogen diffusion coefficient in a Pd crystal for a wide range of temperatures.},

To achieve sign consistency of the computed diabatic couplings, we developed a graphics processing unit-accelerated algorithm called the cluster-growing algorithm. Having obtained consistent signs of the diabatic couplings, we fit the diabatic matrix elements (which consist of the diabatic potentials and the diabatic couplings) to analytic representations. Adiabatic potential energy surfaces are generated by diagonalizing the 3 × 3 diabatic potential energy matrix. The comparisons between the fitted and computed diabatic matrix elements and between the originally computed adiabatic potential energy surfaces and those generated from the fits indicate that the current fit is accurate enough for dynamical studies, and it may be used for quantal or semiclassical dynamics calculations.},

   abstract = {Direct dynamics by mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic methods is an important tool for understanding processes involving multiple electronic states. Very often, the computational bottleneck of such direct simulation comes from electronic structure theory. For example, at every time step of a trajectory, nonadiabatic dynamics requires potential energy surfaces, their gradients, and the matrix elements coupling the surfaces. The need for the couplings can be alleviated by employing the time derivatives of the wave functions, which can be evaluated from overlaps of electronic wave functions at successive time steps. However, evaluation of overlap integrals is still expensive for large systems. In addition, for electronic structure methods for which the wave functions or the coupling matrix elements are not available, nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms become inapplicable. In this work, building on recent work by Baeck and An, we propose new nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms that only require adiabatic potential energies and their gradients. The new methods are named curvature-driven coherent switching with decay of mixing (κCSDM) and curvature-driven trajectory surface hopping (κTSH). We show how powerful these new methods are in terms of computation time and accuracy as compared to previous mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic dynamics algorithms. The lowering of the computational cost will allow longer nonadiabatic trajectories and greater ensemble averaging to be affordable, and the ability to calculate the dynamics without electronic structure coupling matrix elements extends the dynamics capability to new classes of electronic structure methods.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the ability to predict molecular spectra at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional theoretical chemistry methods while maintaining high accuracy. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly promising in this regard, but different types of GNNs have not yet been systematically compared. In this work, we benchmark and analyze five different GNNs for the prediction of excitation spectra from the QM9 dataset of organic molecules. We compare the GNN performance in the obvious runtime measurements, prediction accuracy, and analysis of outliers in the test set. Moreover, through TMAP clustering and statistical analysis, we are able to highlight clear hotspots of high prediction errors as well as optimal spectra prediction for molecules with certain functional groups. This in-depth benchmarking and subsequent analysis protocol lays down a recipe for comparing different ML methods and evaluating dataset quality.},

   abstract = {Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist’s toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.},

   abstract = {Quantum dynamics simulations are an important tool to evaluate molecular behaviour including the, often key, quantum nature of the system. In this paper we present an algorithm that is able to simulate the time evolution of a molecule after photo-excitation into a manifold of states. The direct dynamics variational multi-configurational Gaussian (DD-vMCG) method circumvents the computational bottleneck problems of traditional grid-based methods by computing the potential energy functions on-the-fly, i.e. only where required. Unlike other commonly used direct dynamics methods, DD-vMCG is fully quantum mechanical. Here, the method is combined with a novel on-the-fly diabatisation scheme to simulate the short-time dynamics of the key molecule formamide and its acid analogue formimidic acid. This is a challenging test system due to the nature and large number of excited states, and eight coupled states are included in the calculations. It is shown that the method is able to provide unbiased information on the product channels open after excitation at different energies and demonstrates the potential to be a practical scheme, limited mainly by the quality of the quantum chemistry used to describe the excited states.},

   abstract = {Photodynamical simulations are increasingly used to explore photochemical mechanisms and interpret laser experiments. The vast majority of ab initio excited-state simulations are performed within semiclassical, trajectory-based approaches. Apart from underlying electronic-structure theory, the reliability of simulations is controlled by a selection of initial conditions for the classical trajectories. We discuss appropriate choices of initial conditions for simulations of different experimental arrangements: dynamics initiated by continuum-wave (CW) laser fields or triggered by ultrashort laser pulses. We introduce a new technique, CW-sampling, to treat the former case, based on the ideas of importance sampling, combined with the quantum thermostat approach based on the Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) that allows for efficient sampling of both position and momentum space. The CW-sampling is particularly important for photodynamical processes initiated by absorption at the tail of the UV absorption spectrum. We also emphasize the importance of non-Condon effects for the dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the photodissociation of the CF2Cl2 molecule (Freon CFC-12). A quantitative agreement with the experimental data is achieved with the use of empirical correlation energy correction (CEC) factor on top of FOMO-CASCI potential energy surfaces.},

   booktitle = {Quantum Chemistry and Dynamics of Excited States},
   pages = {413-433},
   abstract = {Summary This chapter provides an overview of the variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG) approach, which belongs to the family of Gaussian wave packet (GWP) methods. It is based on similar grounds to the spawning and related approaches (see Chapter ), but has explicit coupling between the GWP quantum amplitudes. This means that it relies on “quantum trajectories” followed by the centers of the GWPs, rather than classical ones. By this, it is to be understood that the mean positions and momenta are specifically obtained from equations of motions derived from a variational solution to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), in addition to the expansion coefficients, thus resulting in a favorable convergence on the exact solution. GWP methods are attractive ways to solve the TDSE, alternative to grid-based methods such as the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) approach (see Chapter ). Their main advantage is that they provide a way to run direct dynamics with quantum nuclei, whereby the potential-energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings are calculated on-the-fly, much as in trajectory-based approaches (see Chapters –). This is achieved via an interface between quantum-dynamics and quantum-chemistry programs. The direct dynamics variant of vMCG is known as DD-vMCG. The implementation of the method and its performance will be illustrated with three examples: salicylaldimine to show phase-space coverage and tunneling, the butatriene cation to demonstrate how it works within a non-adiabatic context, and formamide to exemplify direct dynamics.},

The origin of such light sensitivity is not understood and a key question is whether in-phase nuclear motion controls the quantum efficiency value. In this study we used hundreds of quantum–classical trajectories to show that, 15 fs after light absorption, a degeneracy between the reactive excited state and a neighbouring state causes the splitting of the rhodopsin population into subpopulations. These subpopulations propagate with different velocities and lead to distinct contributions to the quantum efficiency. We also show here that such splitting is modulated by protein electrostatics, thus linking amino acid sequence variations to quantum efficiency modulation. Finally, we discuss how such a linkage that in principle could be exploited to achieve higher quantum efficiencies would simultaneously increase the receptor thermal noise leading to a trade-off that may have played a role in rhodopsin evolution.},

We employ the on-the-fly surface hopping algorithm with an ab initio quantum chemistry calculation to demonstrate a dynamic simulation for photoisomerization in azobenzene.

However, the accuracy of this simplest nonadiabatic molecular dynamic method has not been extensively compared with the conventional Tully's fewest switches. It is necessary to demonstrate the accuracy of this global switching algorithm. An extensive comparison between local and global switching on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping molecular dynamics is performed for cis-to-trans (800 sampling trajectories) and trans-to-cis (600 sampling trajectories) azobenzene photoisomerization at the OM2/MRCI level. The global switching algorithm is coded into the Newton-X program package. Excellent agreement between the two switching algorithms is obtained not only for highly averaged quantities of quantum yields and lifetimes, but also for detailed contour patterns of product distributions, hopping spot distributions and hopping directions in terms of conical intersections between ground and the first excited states. Therefore, the global switching trajectory surface hopping method can be applied to larger complex systems in which nonadiabatic coupling is not available for excited-state molecular dynamic simulations.},

The present ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamic simulation involving both conical intersection and intersystem crossing is to compute for the first time the population evolution of quantum yields at the four lowest singlet and four lowest triplet states. The simulated results demonstrate not only the stepwise dissociation of O–O and C–C bond breaking, but also confirm the existence of a biradical entropic trap which is responsible for chemiexcitation. The simulated quantum yield of the triplet chemiexcitation ΦT1 = 0.266 ± 0.096 agrees with the experimental value of 0.20 ± 0.04 very well. The present nonadiabatic molecular dynamic simulation of dimethyl 1,2-dioxetanes provides a further advanced understanding and stepping stone for future studies on chemi- and bio-luminescence.},

   abstract = {The analysis of the leading active molecular motions in the on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping simulation provides the essential information to understand the geometric evolution in nonadiabatic dynamics. When the ring deformation is involved, the identification of the key active coordinates becomes challenging. A “hierarchical” protocol based on the dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches is proposed for the automatic analysis of the ring deformation in the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. The representative system keto isocytosine is taken as the prototype to illustrate this protocol. The results indicate that the current hierarchical analysis protocol is a powerful way to clearly clarify both the major and minor active molecular motions of the ring distortion in nonadiabatic dynamics.},

abstract = {A strictly diabatic electronic basis is defined as one for which all components of the nuclear momentum coupling vanish. We examine the possibility that such a basis may exist, and we find that, in general, it does not. The only important exception is for diatomic states of the same symmetry. We also consider some conditions for the definition of an approximately diabatic electronic basis. For molecular systems with three or more nuclei, one can obtain useful approximate diabatic basis sets if the transverse (solenoidal) part of the coupling is negligible; this may occur, for example, if the part of the coupling due to the internuclear-distance dependence of the configurational wave functions is negligible as compared to that due to the internuclear- distance dependence of the configurational coefficients. We derive a criterion showing that such approximations may be useful and accurate if the role of the coupling is important over regions of sufficiently small linear dimensions. {\textcopyright} 1982 American Institute of Physics.},

journal = {J. Phys. Conf. Ser.},
abstract = {Post-calculation analyses are often required to extract physical insights from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In the present work, we use different machine learning classifiers to take a new perspective on the decomposition reaction of dioxetane. Upon thermally activated decomposition, dioxetane can form products in an electronically excited state and can thus chemiluminesce. Simulated dynamics trajectories exhibit both successful and frustrated dissociations. As an exhaustive and systematic study of the decomposition mechanism “by hand” is beyond feasibility, machine learning models have been employed to study the relevant nuclear distortions governing molecular dissociation. According to all classifiers used in the study, the two sets of geometries differ by the in-phase planarisation of the two formaldehyde moieties. New insights are obtained from this analysis: if both moieties are not planar enough when the dissociation is attempted, it is frustrated and the molecule remains trapped. The postponing of the decomposition reaction by the so-called entropic trap enhances the chemiexcitation efficiency.}

abstract = {Global machine learning force fields, with the capacity to capture collective interactions in molecular systems, now scale up to a few dozen atoms due to considerable growth of model complexity with system size. For larger molecules, locality assumptions are introduced, with the consequence that nonlocal interactions are not described. Here, we develop an exact iterative approach to train global symmetric gradient domain machine learning (sGDML) force fields (FFs) for several hundred atoms, without resorting to any potentially uncontrolled approximations. All atomic degrees of freedom remain correlated in the global sGDML FF, allowing the accurate description of complex molecules and materials that present phenomena with far-reaching characteristic correlation lengths. We assess the accuracy and efficiency of sGDML on a newly developed MD22 benchmark dataset containing molecules from 42 to 370 atoms. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated in nanosecond path-integral molecular dynamics simulations for supramolecular complexes in the MD22 dataset.},

This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an  number of clusters.}
